    "\n",
    "This machine learning system is designed to showcase an end-to-end implementation covering the entire lifecycle of a machine learning model. It integrates various MLOps tools and technologies discussed during the DASCI 270 sessions, that includes facilitating data ingestion, preprocessing, training, validation, deployment, and monitoring of the model. The system is also structured to handle drift detection to ensure the model remains effective and accurate over time. This document will guide you through interacting with the deployed **Equipment Failure Prediction** system, including making predictions, retrieving model information, and checking data drift, as well as provide detailed documentation of each component and their functionalities."

    "\n",
    "1. **Machine Learning Model** - This system utilizes XGBoost, a highly efficient and scalable machine learning algorithm for classification tasks. It serves as the core predictive model in our system, specifically designed to predict equipment failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Pipeline (Dagster)** - Orchestrates the workflow for data ingestion, preprocessing, and preparation. Dagster manages the sequence of these operations to ensure data flows correctly from one process to another, maintaining a clear and manageable execution order.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Experiment Tracking (MLflow)** - Provides a framework to track experiments, including model training runs, parameters, metrics, and artifacts, enabling easier debugging and optimization. It stores models, performance metrics, and custom objects like drift reports, making them easy to access and compare across different runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Serving (FastAPI)** - Deploys the trained model through a REST API using FastAPI, facilitating easy access to the model’s predictive capabilities. The API handles requests for predictions and provides model metadata, ensuring input validation and structured outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Containerization (Docker)** - Containerizes the services making up the system to ensure consistency and reproducibility across environments. Each isolated environment (\"container\") contains all necessary dependencies for each service, which can be easily deployed on any system supporting Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Drift Detection (Evidently AI)** - Integrates Evidently AI to monitor the model for any signs of data or concept drift. This component is crucial for maintaining the model's accuracy, providing insights into how the data characteristics and relationships are changing over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Data Validation (Pydantic)** - Ensures that the data received by the API matches the expected format and type. This prevents errors during model prediction and ensures reliable model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Testing (Pytest and Github Actions)** - Uses Pytest to develop and run comprehensive tests that validate the correctness of the data processing and feature engineering components. GitHub Actions automates these tests, ensuring that all code integrations meet quality standards and function as expected."

    "Each prediction is represented as either **`0`** or **`1`**, where **`0`** likely indicates normal operation with no failure detected, while **`1`** suggests a potential failure that may require maintenance. For example, Row 1 has a prediction of **`0`**, meaning no failure was detected, while Row 3 has a prediction of **`1`**, indicating a possible failure. Similar patterns are observed in Rows 8, 11, and 15, where failure predictions appear sporadically.  \n",

Additionally, running a **drift detection analysis** can help determine if the dataset has significantly changed over time, which could impact the model’s accuracy. Finally, evaluating the model’s **performance metrics** (such as accuracy, F1-score, and recall) will help ensure that the predictions remain reliable and actionable."

The analysis examined nine features, all of which exhibited drift, meaning that 100% of the dataset has changed in some way. Since the dataset drift flag is marked as `true`, this suggests that the model may not perform as expected on the new data, potentially leading to unreliable predictions.\n",

Additionally, **tool wear (`1.1567`) and failure type encoding (`1.4140`)** have experienced high levels of drift, suggesting that the nature of failures in the dataset may have changed over time. The **product ID encoding (`0.7212`) and torque (`0.2536`)** have also drifted, meaning that machine and operational characteristics may no longer match historical patterns.\n",

If this drift is due to changes in the operational environment, machine wear, or sensor readings, the model may need to be retrained with updated data to maintain accuracy. Further investigation is required to determine whether the drift is temporary or a sign of a long-term change in the system.
